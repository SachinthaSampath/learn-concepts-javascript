# Inline Script
Inline script is when you add JavaScript code between <script></script> tag. This is how I started JavaScript. I believe most of JavaScript developer have done this at least once in their life time.

This is very good way to get started. There is no external files or dependency to worry about. But this is also perfect recipe for unmaintainable code because of following:

- Lack of Code Reusability: If we need to add another page and need some of the functions from this page, we will have to copy and paste the code
- Lack of Dependency Resolution: You are responsible for having add, reduce and sum functions come before main part of the script.
- Pollution of global namespace: All the functions and variables will reside on global scope.
